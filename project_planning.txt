Project planning:

Classes/Tables:
Employee:
	int id
	String name
	String email
	String password

	void login
	void submitRequest
	void viewPendingRequests
	void viewPastRequests

Manager:
	int id
	String name
	String email
	String password

	void viewRequests
	void approveRequest
	void viewHistoryAll

Request:
	int id
	int empId references Employee(id)
	String title
	String description

Inheritance(?):
			User
		   /	\
		 Empl  Manager


Front-end:
	Pages:
		Employee Login Form   1 servlet
		Manager Login Form    1 servlet
		Submit Request Form   1 servlet

		View Requests    (Might need 4 servlets but could probably do less (1 or 2)
			For specific Employee
				1. past requests
				2. pending requests
			For all employees
				3. pending requests
				4. past requests

Dao:
UserDao
	insert user
	delete user

Tasks:

Person 1 (Users):
	Create employee and manager classes + tables, login forms

Person 2 (Transactions):
	Create request form for reimbursement, also be able to view transactions/approve of them

Later, regroup and add checks for employee vs manager (ex: only manager can approve requests, etc.())

Notes:
 - Functionality first, styling later
