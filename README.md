## Squid-Expense-Reimbursement-System

# Overview
Project 1 guidelines stated that we create an expense reimbursement system for employees and managers. We decided to put a little spin into it and we created a project with the theme of Squid Games. This reimbursement system allows for employees to request and view pending requests of reimbursements. Whereas for managers, they are given the ability to look at all requests and then the ability to accept or deny them.

# Technologies

* JDBC
* MySQL
* HTML
* CSS

* Tomcat Server 9.0

# Features
This project includes a login page where its universal for either an employee or manager to login. As an employee, they would be able to make requests and view their pending requests. They would give the reimbursement a title, description, and then select an amount they would like in return. As a manager, they would be able to view all requests made by employees and they be able to look at a list of requests and select whether to approve or reject any.

# Getting started
To get started follow these steps:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/asalvero/Squid-Expense-Reimbursement-System
```

Then open in your favorite editor/IDE and make sure you have Tomcat Server 9.0 installed and running.

Then just open your browser, type in selected localhost port number, and place the correct path (use localhost:{port number}/index).

Once in, select the different tabs.

To gain access to the database, make sure you create your own in your MySQL database and make changes with your username and password in the hibernate.cfg.xml file which is located under the resources folder.
